# ESP32-S3-BOX firmware with Alexa wakeword model

The current [ESP32-BOX firmware version 0.2.1](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box) uses the Hi ESP wakeword that has a poor response.

The firmware in this respository has been built using [the ESP-BOX factory demo](https://github.com/espressif/esp-box/tree/master/examples/factory_demo) but configured with the Alexa wakeword model that has a much better response.
